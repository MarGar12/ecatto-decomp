# Element Cattos Decomp

Element Cattos is a 2D pixel science sandbox where you can play around with elements as cats! or so called... Cattos! You can view more in Oberorka's itch.io page: https://oberorka.itch.io/elementcattos
This repository serves all the code available from versions alpha 0.13 and onwards of Element Cattos (including my merged mod).
