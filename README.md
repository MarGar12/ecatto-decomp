# Element Cattos Decomp

Element Cattos is a 2D pixel science sandbox where you can play around with elements as cats! or so called... Cattos! You can view more in Oberorka's itch.io page: https://oberorka.itch.io/elementcattos
This repository serves all the code available from versions alpha 0.13 and onwards of Element Cattos (including my merged mod).

This branch contains my modded code for Alpha 0.13, which will be merged to the official game.
Branches with _4.1.1 as of now are original decomps of the executable, while those without it are ports to the latest Godot version.
